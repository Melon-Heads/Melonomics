Apologies for how unorganised this is.

To run the software, ensure you have the app folder:

The app folder should consist of static, template and data folders. Additionally if biopython needs to be brought into the python path, it would be a good idea to copy the biopython folder here too.

Additionally directly inside the app folder (so along with the folders mentioned above), you need the BLAST.py and final.py scripts.

This is the file hierarchy:

|- app
|
|- static
|       |
|       - [Any files within the static folder]
|
|- templates
|       |
|       - [Any files within the templates folder]
|
|- BLAST.py
|
|- final.py
